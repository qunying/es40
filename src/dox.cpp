 * \section intro Introduction
 * Welcome to the documentation for the ES40 Emulator Project. For the
 * main project page, goto http://sourceforge.net/projects/es40.
 *
 * On these pages here, you can find the documented source code. In the future,
 * you might also find release notes, installation instructions, and compilation
 * instructions here.

/**
 * \page faq Frequently Asked Questions
 * Here, you can find the answers to a few frequently asked questions.
 * 
 * \section a A. Compilation
 * Compilation related issues.
 *
 * \subsection a1 A1. SDL not found
 * Q: I get warnings about SDL.H, sdl.lib, sdlmain.lib or sdl.dll not being 
 * found. What do I need?
 *
 * A: You need the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) libraries, if you want to
 * use one of the emulated VGA cards. Visit http://www.libsdl.org. To run 
 * the emulator you need the runtime libraries, to compile the emulator you
 * need the development libraries. Make sure your compiler/linker can find
 * the header and library files.
 *
 * \subsection a2 A2. SDL not available
 * Q: SDL is not available for my system, or I don't want to install it. 
 * What are my options?
 *
 * A: Compile without HAVE_SDL defined. For Windows, you can download the
 * no_sdl version of the binary package. If you're on Windows, change the
 * configuration file (gui=win32), if your system supports X-Windows (as is
 * the case on most Linux/BSD/UNIX distributions, change it to gui=X11.
 * If your system is not supported, remove the gui section alltogether, as
 * well as any vga-card sections. Graphics support will nbot be available
 * in this case.
 *
 * \subsection a3 A3. PCAP not found
 * Q: I get warnings about pcap.h, wpcap.lib, wpcap.dll, or libpcap not being 
 * found. What do I need?
 *
 * A: You need the libpcap (Linux and others) or winpcap (Windows) packet
 * capture libraries, if you want to use one of the emulated network cards.
 * Visit http://www.tcpdump.org or http://www.winpcap.org. To run the emulator
 * you need the runtime libraries, to compile the emulator you need the 
 * developer's pack. Make sure your compiler/linker can find the header and
 * library files.
 *
 * \subsection a4 A4. PCAP not available
 * Q: PCAP is not available for my system, or I don't want to install it. 
 * What are my options?
 *
 * A: Your only option is to disable network support, by compiling without
 * HAVE_PCAP defined. For Windows, you can download the no_net version of
 * the binary package.
 *
 * \subsection a5 A5. Endianess issues
 * Q: I'm running the ES40 emulator on a big endian host machine (PowerPC,
 * Sparc) and I get all these strange errors. Network, graphics and disks
 * don't seem to work properly.
 *
 * A: Support for big-endian host architectures has been available in the
 * past, but since the primary developer of the ES40 Emulator no longer
 * has a big endian machine, it has become difficult to support and
 * maintain. If you can, please help us get the emulator working on big-
 * endian architectures again!
 *
 * \section b B. Configuration
 * Configuration related issues.
 *
 * \subsection b1 B1. Which VGA card?
 * Q: Which of the two emulated VGA cards should I choose? S3 Trio64 or
 * Cirrus?
 *
 * A: Right now, both cards are nearly identical (except for the PCI
 * configuration ID, which tells the OS what card this is). In the future,
 * the emulated Cirrus card will evolve into a more complete card, 
 * supporting various SVGA features. For the S3 Trio, this is more difficult,
 * because documentation is harder to find. Also, we chose to continue with
 * Cirrus, because the Bochs emulator emulates a Cirrus card, and we can
 * borrow bits of their code.
 *
 * \subsection b2 B2. CD-ROM on Windows?
 * Q: How do I connect my real CD drive under Windows so that I can have ES40
 * boot a real AlphaVMS CD?
 *
 * A: I'm planning to create a DiskDevice class that does this, but I
 * haven't gotten around to it yet... Right now, it isn't possible yet.
 * You could use a CD-burning tool to create an ISO image, and boot using
 * that image. That's what I do.
 *
 * UPDATE: The current version in CVS, and the next release will make this
 * possibe; check the sample configuration file in CVS for information.
