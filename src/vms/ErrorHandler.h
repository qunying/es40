	/// An unhandled exception that causes a thread to terminate is usually
	/// silently ignored, since the class library cannot do anything meaningful
	/// about it.

	/// been terminated by an unhandled exception.
	/// The ErrorHandler must be derived from this class and can
	/// provide implementations of all three handleException() overloads.

	/// The ErrorHandler is always invoked within the context of
	/// the offending thread.
